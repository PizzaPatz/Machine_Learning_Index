    "In machine learning, GPUs and/or CPUs are needed for model training, thus computation cost can be very expensive (literally). However, Google has provided cloud computing which allows users to utilize the processors remotely. What does it mean? It means that users will not be using their processors locally to do machine learning computation, instead, the data processing will be done at Google Cloud (or Google server) and it will not exhaust your computer at all. You can even use the $100 laptop that has an Internet connection to process thousands of dataset remotely."
